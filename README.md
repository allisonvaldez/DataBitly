# USA.Gov Data From Bitly

This is an analysis that explores the partnership between the US government and Bitly. The contract provided a feed of anonymous data collected from users who shorted website links ending with .gov or .mil. Hourly snapshots were provided on the dynamic information as well as downloadable text files. Unfortunately, the project is no longer active between the two entities. If there are any questions or concerns the author may be contacted to discuss analysis and methodology.
