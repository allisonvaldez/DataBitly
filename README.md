# USA.Gov Data From Bitly

This is an analysis that explores the partnership between the US government and Bitly. The contract provided a feed of anonymous data collected from users who shorted website links ending with .gov or .mil. Hourly snapshots were provided on the dynamic information as well as downloadable text files. Unfortunately, the project is no longer active between the two entities. This project's purpose was to:

- Explore what was collected amongst users during the project.
- Compare and contrast the differences in calculating timezones in pure pythons and pandas.
- Experiment with data visisualization.
